# Henry's To Do App

Using MVC architecture and the slim framework I have created a CRUD application for a to do list.  Through doing this I have demonstrated an understanding of SQL, object oriented programming in PHP as well as front end development using html and CSS.

## Install the Application

Create a new directory with your project name, e.g:


```bash
mkdir academyProject
```

Once inside the new directory, clone this repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Henry-Tottle/my_To_Do.git .
```

One cloned, you must install the slim components by running:

```bash
composer install
```

To run the application locally:
```bash
composer start

```
Run this command in the application directory to run the test suite
```bash
composer test
```

Now start scheduling!
